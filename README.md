# Kantify-app

**Kantify** is an interactive web application that, using the Kantian ethics of universalization, helps you reflect deeply on the global ethical consequences of your everyday decisions.  
It does not judge whether your actions are ‚Äúgood or bad‚Äù, but generates simulations that allow you to clearly see what would happen if everyone acted as you do.  
It uses sliders for nuanced responses, Bayesian network analysis, and dynamic generation of ethical questions and scenarios using artificial intelligence.
